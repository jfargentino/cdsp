The orginal introduction is in file "READ.ME".

I have the book with its 5"1/4 floppy disk, but no hardware to read it.
I guess I've found these files on a forum, so I can not garantee that they
are what they stand for.

It is at least the 2nd time somebody ask me for these, so I put them online.

If it is a problem due to copyright, malware presence (sorry no scanner at
hands) whatever... please open an issue.
